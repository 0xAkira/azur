<p>Enterprise has shown to be affectionate and caring for her friends and will do anything to protect them, even putting herself in danger including the Commander.
    In the Anime, she was shown to be very introverted throughout the episode and was less social with other ships except Cleveland. she also shown to be very warring about comparing humans between shipgirls as different species, not until Belfast, who was ordered by Queen Elizabeth to watch over Enterprise to check up on her for a while being. Enterprise has always been frowning most of the time as well and also very refusal when Belfast tells her to eat and was unwilling due to her habit of eating MRE all day without a proper meal. After Episode 12, Enterprise becomes a complete different person and which lead her to who she is now currently.</p>
